      <p>I'm intrested in or was lead to programming because of games.  Before really thinking how games where made I just played them, but I eventualy was caught by my own curiosity. A game had gliched while I was playing.  I thought at first what made this happen and how can I prevent this aggen.  I soon after, shearched around and found more bugs for various reasons. Then it clicked, they had missed or forgot something in the code that allowed the bug/error to occer.  I looked in to programing with my father and found out that it might be for my logical mind and I.</p>
