      <p>I'm intrested in programming because of games.  before really thinking how games where made i just played them, but I eventualy was caught by my curiosity. A game had gliched while I was playing.  I thought at first what made this happen and how can I prevent this aggen.  I soon after, shearched around and found more bugs for various reasons.  I and then it clicked, they had missed or forgot something in the code that allowed for it to occer.  I looked in to programing with my father and found out that it might be for me and my logical mind.</p>
